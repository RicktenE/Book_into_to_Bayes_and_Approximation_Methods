# Intro_to_Bayes_and_Approximation_Methods
 This book gives an overview of bayesian inference and approximation methods. The motivation for this book was to find a method to approximate the posterior distribution and use this approximation as a prior distribution for the next step. The challenge lies in finding a suitable approximation method that can also represent the multilevel dependencies in the original data.
