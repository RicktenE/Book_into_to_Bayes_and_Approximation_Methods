# Introduction to Bayesian Inference with R and Python

In this tutorial, we will learn about Bayesian inference and how to perform it in R and some examples will be in Python. Bayesian inference is a method of statistical inference in which Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. This method allows us to incorporate prior knowledge into our analysis and make more informed decisions.

We will begin by discussing the basics of Bayesian inference and Bayes' theorem. Next, we will learn about the various types of prior distributions that can be used in Bayesian analysis. Finally, we will walk through several examples of Bayesian inference in R using the rstan package for Bayesian modeling.

Before diving in, it is important to note that some understanding of probability and statistics is recommended for following along with this tutorial. Additionally, the rstan package requires the Rtools to be installed on your system.

Let's get started!

# Bayes' Theorem

Bayes' theorem is the foundation of Bayesian inference. It states that the probability of a hypothesis (H) given some data (D) is proportional to the probability of the data given the hypothesis (D\|H) multiplied by the prior probability of the hypothesis (H).

Mathematically, it can be represented as:

$$P(H|D) = (P(D|H) * P(H)) / P(D)$$

Where:

$P(H|D)$ is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the data. $P(D|H)$ is the likelihood of the data given the hypothesis. $P(H)$ is the prior probability of the hypothesis. $P(D)$ is the marginal likelihood, also known as the evidence. The posterior probability, $P(H|D)$, represents our updated belief about the hypothesis after taking into account the data. The prior probability, $P(H)$, represents our initial belief about the hypothesis before taking into account the data. The likelihood, $P(D|H)$, represents how likely the data is given the hypothesis. The marginal likelihood, $P(D)$, is a normalizing constant that ensures the posterior probability is a valid probability distribution.

In Bayesian inference, we use Bayes' theorem to update our belief about a hypothesis by incorporating new data. The process of updating our belief is known as updating the prior to the posterior.

# Prior Distribution

In Bayesian inference, prior distribution is used to express our initial belief about the parameters of the model before observing the data. Prior distributions can be chosen based on previous knowledge, expert opinion, or other sources of information.

There are different types of prior distributions that can be used in Bayesian analysis, including:

Non-informative prior: A non-informative prior is a prior distribution that has minimal information about the parameters of the model. Examples of non-informative priors include the uniform distribution and the improper prior.

Conjugate prior: A conjugate prior is a prior distribution that belongs to the same family as the likelihood function. When a conjugate prior is used, the posterior distribution also belongs to the same family as the prior and the likelihood.

Empirical prior: An empirical prior is a prior distribution that is based on historical data. Empirical priors are often used when there is no prior knowledge available about the parameters of the model.

Informative prior: An informative prior is a prior distribution that incorporates a significant amount of information about the parameters of the model. Informative priors are often used when there is a lot of prior knowledge available about the parameters of the model.

It is important to note that the choice of prior distribution can have a significant impact on the results of Bayesian analysis. In general, it is a good practice to choose a prior distribution that reflects our current knowledge or belief about the parameters of the model.

# Bayesian Inference in R

In R, the rstan package is widely used for Bayesian modeling. rstan is an interface to the Stan C++ library for Bayesian inference and it allows users to fit Bayesian models using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) or Variational Inference (VI).

To start using rstan, we first need to install the package and its dependencies. The installation of the rstan package requires the Rtools to be installed on the system.

```{r}
# https://blog.mc-stan.org/2022/04/26/stan-r-4-2-on-windows/
# install.packages("rstan")

# Remove currently installed rstan andd StanHeaders packages
# If you have not installed these packages yet, proceed to step 2.

# remove.packages(c("rstan", "StanHeaders"))
# Install from the Stan R package repository

# install.packages("rstan", repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))

```

Once the package is installed, we can begin by specifying the model we want to fit using the Stan language. The Stan language is a probabilistic programming language that is used to specify Bayesian models. It allows us to define the likelihood function, prior distributions, and the parameters of the model.

In order to fit a Bayesian model using rstan, we need to do the following steps:

Fit the model to the data using the sampling() function. Here is an example of how to fit a simple linear regression model using rstan:

```{r}
library(StanHeaders)
library(ggplot2)
library(rstan)
options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())
rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE)

# Step 1: Write the model in Stan language
model <- "
data {
  int<lower=0> N;
  vector[N] x;
  vector[N] y;
}
parameters {
  real alpha;
  real beta;
  real<lower=0> sigma;
}
model {
  y ~ normal(alpha + beta * x, sigma);
}
"

# Step 2: Compile the model
model <- stan_model(model_code = model)

# Step 3: Fit the model to the data
data <- list(N = 100, x = rnorm(100), y = rnorm(100))
fit <- sampling(model, data = data)

```

In this example, we specified the model in Stan language as a string and passed it to the stan_model() function. The model is defined by three parameters, alpha, beta, and sigma, and a likelihood function, which is a normal distribution. We also specified the data that we want to fit the model to.

After fitting the model, we can extract the posterior samples using the extract() function and use them to make inferences about the parameters of the model. We can also use the summary() function to get a summary of the posterior samples.

In the next section, we will walk through more examples of Bayesian inference in R using rstan. We will discuss how to specify different types of prior distributions, how to perform model checking, and how to make inferences from the posterior samples.


# Model Checking

After fitting a Bayesian model, it is important to check the model's fit to the data. This process is known as model checking. Model checking helps us to ensure that the model is a good fit to the data and that the posterior samples are representative of the true posterior distribution.

There are several methods for model checking in Bayesian inference. Some of the most common methods include:

Trace plots: A trace plot shows the progression of the Markov chain for each parameter. It helps to check for convergence and to identify any problems with the sampling process.

Autocorrelation plots: An autocorrelation plot shows the correlation between the samples at different lags. It helps to check for independence of the samples and to identify any problems with the mixing of the Markov chain.

Density plots: A density plot shows the distribution of the posterior samples for each parameter. It helps to check for unimodality and to identify any problems with the choice of prior distribution.


# Making Inferences from Posterior Samples

Once we have performed model checking and ensured that the model is a good fit to the data, we can use the posterior samples to make inferences about the parameters of the model .

One way to make inferences is by calculating summary statistics of the posterior samples, such as the mean, median, and credible intervals. The mean and median of the posterior samples provide a point estimate of the parameter, while the credible intervals provide a range of plausible values.

Another way to make inferences is by visualizing the posterior samples using plots such as histograms and kernel density plots. These plots can help to understand the shape of the posterior distribution and the uncertainty of the estimates.

Additionally, we can use the posterior samples to simulate from the model. This can help to understand the predictions of the model, for example, we can use the posterior samples to predict the outcomes of new data.

# Conclusion

In this guide, we will discus the basics of Bayesian inference in R using the rstan package. We have shown how to specify a model in Stan language, how to fit the model to the data, and how to make inferences from the posterior samples. We will also discus the importance of model checking and the different methods for making inferences from the posterior samples.

Bayesian inference is a powerful tool for statistical modeling and can be applied to a wide range of problems. The rstan package provides a flexible and efficient way to perform Bayesian inference in R. It allows us to specify complex models, perform model checking, and make inferences from the posterior samples with ease.
